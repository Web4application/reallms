                    <description>Researchers have discovered that the ability to have an erection or to orgasm is related to the levels of serotonin in the brain, but this relation only applies to depressed patients taking SSRI antidepressants.</description>

                    <description>Older patients who primarily speak a language other than English may face a greater risk of developing delirium after surgery in U.S. hospitals, according to new research presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY 2025 annual meeting. The study also found that a lower socioeconomic status further increased patients&#039; risk.</description>

                    <title>DNA repair mechanisms help explain why naked mole-rats live a long life</title>
                    <description>Naked mole-rats are one of nature&#039;s most extraordinary creatures. These burrowing rodents can live for up to 37 years, around ten times longer than relatives of a similar size. But what is the secret to their extreme longevity? How are they able to delay the decay and decline that befalls other rodents? The answer, at least in part, is due to a switch in a common protein that boosts DNA repair, according to new research published in the journal Science.</description>

                    <description>Food systems make up roughly 30% of total greenhouse gas emissions globally. But transforming them could cut these emissions by more than half, according to a report released Oct. 3 from a commission of global experts from more than 35 countries across six continents.</description>

                    <description>Cochlear implants give children with profound hearing loss a much better chance to learn spoken language. However, the sounds from a cochlear implant aren&#039;t as clear as natural hearing, making it harder for children to connect the way they move their mouths with the sounds they hear.</description>

                    <description>Dark matter is an enigmatic form of matter not expected to emit light, yet it is essential to understanding how the rich tapestry of stars and galaxies we see in the night sky evolved. As a fundamental building block of the universe, a key question for astronomers is whether dark matter is smooth or clumpy, as this could reveal what it is made of. Since dark matter cannot be observed directly, its properties can only be determined by observing the gravitational lensing effect, whereby the light from a more distant object is distorted and deflected by the gravity of the dark object.</description>

                    <description>For years, researchers have puzzled over how the ancient people of Rapa Nui did the seemingly impossible and moved their iconic moai statues. Using a combination of physics, 3D modeling and on-the-ground experiments, a team including faculty at Binghamton University, State University of New York, has confirmed that the statues actually walked—with a little rope and remarkably few people.</description>

What happens to these particles within atoms would stay unexplained without this tool. The calculations using virtual particles predict the bizarre behavior of subatomic particles with such uncanny accuracy that some scientists think &quot;they must really exist.&quot;</description>

                    <description>According to a new Physical Review Letters study, black holes could help solve the dark matter mystery. The shadowy regions in black hole images captured by the Event Horizon Telescope can act as ultra-sensitive detectors for the invisible material that makes up most of the universe&#039;s matter.</description>

                    <description>Not all stars are created equally. Astronomers believe that the first stars to form after the Big Bang were mostly made of only hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of lithium, as the heavier elements formed later on by nuclear fusion inside the stars. When these stars went supernova, heavier elements spread throughout space and formed more stars. Each successive generation contained more heavy elements, and these elements also became successively heavier.</description>

                    <description>Quantum networks, systems consisting of connected quantum computers, quantum sensors or other quantum devices, hold the potential of enabling faster and safer communications. The establishment of these networks relies on a quantum phenomenon known as entanglement, which entails a link between particles or systems, with the quantum state of one influencing the other even when they are far apart.</description>

                    <description>From Disney&#039;s Scrooge McDuck and Cruella de Vil to DC Comics&#039; Lex Luthor and Mr. Burns in the Simpsons, there are plenty of examples of wealthy people using their money and power in evil ways. But is there any truth to the stereotype that rich people are mean?</description>

                    <description>Many survey-based studies have been conducted to try to understand how happiness changes over a person&#039;s lifetime. While there have been a few different outcomes, the most common has been the U-shaped curve. This pattern indicates that, on average, people are happier at the beginning of adulthood, they experience a dip during midlife (the so-called &quot;midlife crisis&quot;), and happiness then increases again in old age. Yet, other similar studies have reported inconsistent patterns—steady happiness throughout life, steady increases, steady decreases or even inverse U-shapes.</description>

                    <description>For the first time, researchers have successfully fabricated and characterized a fully functional mirror-image nanopore—a molecular gateway built entirely from D-amino acids, the mirror-image forms of the natural building blocks of proteins. The work, led by Prof. Dr. Kozhinjampara R. Mahendran at the Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology (India) in collaboration with Constructor University and other partners, demonstrates not only a major milestone in nanoscience but also opens promising biomedical applications, including potential cancer therapies.</description>

                    <description>An international team of astronomers has used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe a well-known quasar known as the Cloverleaf. As part of the observations, they serendipitously discovered a new ultra-luminous infrared galaxy. The finding was reported September 30 in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.</description>

                    <description>This week, researchers discovered so-called &quot;switchbacks&quot; in Earth&#039;s magnetic field similar to observations of switchbacks in the sun&#039;s magnetic field. Scientists provided more evidence that ancient Rapa Nui engineers &quot;walked&quot; Easter Island&#039;s iconic statues along carefully designed roads. And satellite imagery revealed a record 20-meter-high ocean wave. We also reported on a unique method for eliciting childhood memories, the smallest chunk of dark matter ever observed, and the pernicious effects of empty praise from chatbots:</description>

                    <description>Quantum defects are tiny imperfections in solid crystal lattices that can trap individual electrons and their &quot;spin&quot; (i.e., the internal angular momentum of particles). These defects are central to the functioning of various quantum technologies, including quantum sensors, computers and communication systems.</description>

                    <description>In recent years, NASA&#039;s Parker Solar Probe has given us a close-up look at the sun. Among the probe&#039;s revelations was the presence of numerous kinks, or &quot;switchbacks,&quot; in magnetic field lines in the sun&#039;s outer atmosphere. These switchbacks are thought to form when solar magnetic field lines that point in opposite directions break and then snap together, or &quot;reconnect,&quot; in a new arrangement, leaving telltale zigzag kinks in the reconfigured lines.</description>

                    <description>In a recent study, mathematicians from Freie Universität Berlin have demonstrated that planar tiling, or tessellation, is much more than a way to create a pretty pattern. Consisting of a surface covered by one or more geometric shapes with no gaps and no overlaps, tessellations can also be used as a precise tool for solving complex mathematical problems.</description>

                    <description>Gravitational waves are energy-carrying waves produced by the acceleration or disturbance of massive objects. These waves, which were first directly observed in 2015, are known to be produced during various cosmological phenomena, including mergers between two black holes that orbit each other (i.e., binary black holes).</description>

                    <description>When people are highly stressed for prolonged periods of time, they can sometimes experience a state known as burnout, characterized by pronounced emotional, mental and physical exhaustion. The stressors leading to burnout could be personal, such as family conflicts or the end of a relationship, as well as academic or professional, such as studying a lot for exams or working long hours while taking very few breaks or vacations.</description>

                    <description>One of the most notable properties of the giant planets in our solar system—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune—are the extreme winds observed around their equators. While some of these planets have eastward equatorial winds, others have a westward jet stream. For the first time, an international team of scientists led by Leiden Observatory and SRON, can explain the winds on all the giant planets using one model.</description>

                    <title>From toilet cleaners to tail-tugging—new study reveals complex social behaviors of naked mole-rats</title>
                    <description>Naked mole-rats are one of the rare examples of eusocial mammals. Eusocial animal species are those in which a single female within the group is tasked with reproduction, along with a select group of males, while the rest of the group focuses on other tasks related to maintaining the living area, gathering food, or caring for young. This kind of caste system is most often seen in insects, like ants and bees.</description>

                    <description>Some industrial processes used to create useful chemicals require heat, but heating methods are often inefficient, partly because they heat a greater volume of space than they really need to. Researchers, including those from the University of Tokyo, devised a way to limit heating to the specific areas required in such situations. Their technique uses microwaves, not unlike those used in home microwave ovens, to excite specific elements dispersed in the materials to be heated. Their system proved to be around 4.5 times more efficient than current methods.</description>

                    <description>For millions of years, a fragment of ice and dust drifted between the stars—like a sealed bottle cast into the cosmic ocean. This summer, that bottle finally washed ashore in our solar system and was designated 3I/ATLAS, only the third known interstellar comet. When Auburn University scientists pointed NASA&#039;s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory toward it, they made a remarkable find: the first detection of hydroxyl (OH) gas from this object, a chemical fingerprint of water.</description>

                    <description>Training animals in captivity is extraordinarily challenging due to a host of factors such as an animal&#039;s natural temperament and prior negative experiences with humans. But it is often essential in places like zoos and conservation centers because animals need routine checkups and veterinary care. In a study of 12 red brocket deer (Mazama americana) in Brazil, scientists found that calm deer were much easier to train for medical procedures than restless or agitated deer.</description>

                    <description>The aim of immunotherapy strategies is to leverage cells in the patient&#039;s own immune system to destroy tumor cells. Using a preclinical model, scientists from the Institut Pasteur and Inserm successfully stimulated an effective anti-tumor immune response by reprogramming the death of malignant B cells. They demonstrated an effective triple-therapy approach for treating forms of blood cancer such as certain lymphomas and leukemias which affect B cells. The study was published on August 15 in the journal Science Advances.</description>

                    <description>One of the key steps in developing new materials is property identification, which has long relied on massive amounts of experimental data and expensive equipment, limiting research efficiency. A KAIST research team has introduced a new technique that combines physical laws, which govern deformation and interaction of materials and energy, with artificial intelligence. This approach allows for rapid exploration of new materials even under data-scarce conditions and provides a foundation for accelerating design and verification across multiple engineering fields, including materials, mechanics, energy, and electronics.</description>

                    <description>For decades, ethicists have argued that lotteries could be the fairest way to decide who gets life-saving treatment when there isn&#039;t enough to go around. Yet our research suggests that most people would rather leave the choice to medical experts than to luck.</description>

                    <description>Glaciers are fighting back against climate change by cooling the air that touches their surfaces. But for how long? The Pellicciotti group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) has compiled and re-analyzed an unprecedented dataset of on-glacier observations worldwide. Their findings, published today in Nature Climate Change, demonstrate that glaciers will likely reach the peak of their self-cooling power by the next decade before their near-surface temperatures spike up and melting accelerates.</description>

                    <description>Ice cream comes in many different flavors. But even pure ice, which consists only of water molecules, has been discovered to exist in more than 20 different solid forms or phases that differ in the arrangement of the molecules. The phases are named with Roman numerals, like ice I, ice II or ice III. Now, researchers led by scientists from the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) have identified and described a new phase called ice XXI. The results are published in the journal Nature Materials.</description>

                    <description>Light is fast, but travels in long wavelengths and interacts weakly with itself. The particles that make up matter are tiny and interact strongly with each other, but move slowly. Together, the two can combine into a hybrid quasiparticle called a polariton that is part light, part matter.</description>

                    <description>Ferroic materials such as ferromagnets and ferroelectrics underpin modern data storage, yet face limits: They switch slowly, or suffer from unstable polarization due to depolarizing fields respectively. A new class, ferroaxials, avoids these issues by hosting vortices of dipoles with clockwise or anticlockwise textures, but are hard to control.</description>

                    <description>As the world mourns Jane Goodall, the pioneering chimpanzee scientist and campaigner who died last week aged 91, it&#039;s worth asking what chimpanzees can still teach us about climate change. They not only have a few tricks for surviving a warming planet—they&#039;ve also helped to cool it.</description>

                    <description>Black mambas (Dendroaspis polylepis) are Africa&#039;s longest, most famous venomous snakes. Despite their fearsome reputation, these misunderstood snakes are vital players in their ecosystems. They keep rodent populations in check and, in turn, help to protect crops and limit disease spread. The species ranges widely across sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal to Somalia and south into South Africa. They can adapt to many environments.</description>

                    <description>At a time when biodiversity is under severe pressure from human activities, understanding how evolution works is more important than ever. A new study about vole teeth, published in PNAS, reveals that evolution doesn&#039;t always require complicated genetic changes to create complex new features.</description>

                    <description>Hippos, today restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, survived in central Europe far longer than previously assumed. Analyses of bone finds demonstrate that hippos inhabited the Upper Rhine Graben sometime between approximately 47,000 and 31,000 years ago, well into the last ice age. An international research team led by the University of Potsdam and the Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen Mannheim with the Curt-Engelhorn-Zentrum Archäometrie have now published a study on this in the journal Current Biology.</description>

                    <description>A research team at CiQUS (University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain) has unveiled an innovative molecular approach that enables anticancer drugs to reach the nucleus of tumor cells, where they can exert their therapeutic effect. The study focused on doxorubicin, a widely used chemotherapy agent. Prolonged exposure to this drug often leads to the emergence of resistant cells, a major clinical challenge that this strategy successfully overcomes while preserving the drug&#039;s antitumor activity.</description>

                    <description>Scientists at the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP) have uncovered the intricate magnetic heartbeat of a distant star remarkably similar to our own sun—but much younger and more active. This study, part of the &quot;Far Beyond the Sun&quot; campaign, follows nearly three years of ultra-precise observations and sheds new light on how stars like our sun generate their magnetic fields—and how these fields evolve over time.</description>

                    <title>Key regulator for microalgae&#039;s adaptation to low-CO₂ environments identified</title>
                    <description>Marine microalgae are vital drivers of Earth&#039;s carbon cycle, contributing approximately half of the planet&#039;s global primary production and sequestering tens of gigatons of carbon annually through photosynthesis. To survive and thrive in seawater with low carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, these microorganisms depend on specialized and efficient CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs). For years, the regulatory factors that trigger CCM activation have remained incompletely understood—until recent scientific research began to unravel this biological process.</description>

                    <description>Antarctic krill, tiny shrimp-like creatures, are an important species in the Southern Ocean ecosystem and global carbon cycle, in part because of their poop. Their dense and rich fecal pellets sink rapidly, transporting carbon from surface waters to the deep ocean. In a new study published in the journal Biology Letters, scientists have discovered another way these crustaceans keep carbon locked away from the atmosphere—by ejecting carbon-rich masses of rejected food, called food boluses, that also plummet to the ocean depths.</description>

                    <description>Inside nearly every cell of your body, the tiny F1 motor works non-stop to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the universal energy source that powers almost every action you take—from breathing to running. While scientists have understood the structure of this molecular machine for years, a key mystery remained: how does its partner, the F0 motor, spin F1 with maximum efficiency?</description>

                    <description>Chinese researchers have developed a novel method to efficiently engineer natural killer (NK) cells for cancer immunotherapy. NK cells are central to early antiviral and anticancer defense—among other immune system roles—making them well-suited for cancer immunotherapy. For example, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK therapy involves adding a lab-built receptor (a CAR) to an NK cell, enabling it to recognize a specific antigen on a cancer cell and attack it.</description>

                    <description>During recent storms, satellites recorded ocean waves averaging nearly 20 meters high—as tall as the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and the largest ever measured from space. Moreover, satellite data now reveal that ocean swells act as storm &quot;messengers&quot;: even though a storm may never make landfall, its swell can travel vast distances and bring destructive energy to distant coastlines.</description>

                    <description>Optical lattice clocks are emerging timekeeping devices based on tens of thousands of ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice (i.e., a grid of laser light). By oscillating between two distinct quantum states at a particular frequency, these atoms could help to measure time with much higher precision than existing clocks, which would be highly advantageous for the study of various fundamental physical processes and systems.</description>

                    <title>Quantum fluctuations found hidden beneath classical optical signals in polaritons</title>
                    <description>When optical materials (molecules or solid-state semiconductors) are embedded in tiny photonic boxes, known as optical microcavities, they form hybrid light-matter states known as polaritons. Most of the optical properties of polaritons under weak illumination can be understood using textbook classical optics. Now researchers from UC San Diego show that this is not the entire story: there are quantum fluctuations lurking underneath the classical signal and they reveal a great deal about the molecules in question.</description>

                    <description>A new study has challenged a popular explanation for the unexpected 30-second shortening of Dimorphos&#039;s orbital period. The researchers found that the proposed mechanism would actually produce the opposite effect, given the gravitational dynamics of the small moon. The paper has been accepted for publication in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics and is currently available on the arXiv preprint server.</description>

                    <description>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising non-invasive neuroimaging technique that works by detecting changes in blood oxygenation linked to neural activity using near-infrared light. Compared to fMRI and various other methods commonly used to study the brain, fNIRS is easier to apply outside of laboratory settings.</description>

                    <description>Researchers have found that low to moderate-severity fires not only benefit many bird species in the Sierra Nevada, but these benefits may persist for decades. In addition to a handful of bird species already known to be &quot;post-fire specialists,&quot; a broad variety of other more generalist species, like Dark-eyed Juncos and Mountain Chickadees, clearly benefited from wildfire.</description>

                    <title>Scientists identify a new dendritic nanotubular network in the brain that may contribute to Alzheimer&#039;s disease</title>
                    <description>Neurons in the brain communicate with each other through synapses—connection points that allow the passage of electrical and chemical signals. In non-neuronal cells, direct cell-to-cell connections have been found to occur with the assistance of nanotube structures. In particular, tunneling nanotubes (TNT) have exhibited material exchange in some cell types. These TNTs have been documented in dissociated neurons in the brain, but their presence and function in mature brain neurons was unclear.</description>

                    <description>Why should women in British Columbia, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island and the Yukon have access to free contraception while the rest of Canadians do not? Our new research, published in the British Medical Journal and JAMA Pediatrics, underscores the urgent need for universal prescription contraception coverage nationwide. Spoiler alert: cost matters.</description>
